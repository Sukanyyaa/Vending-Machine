# Vending-Machine
Designed and simulated afully functional Verilog-based vending machine and tested on **EDA Playground**, implementing a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** for coin detection and handle change dispending logic, ensuring accurate operation across all input scenarios.

---
##  Features
- Accepts input coins (e.g., ₹5,₹10)
- An item is dispensed at ₹15
- Simulated using testbench and waveform output
---
##  Tools Used
- **EDA Playground** for simulation
- **Verilog HDL** for hardware description
